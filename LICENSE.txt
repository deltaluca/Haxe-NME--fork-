NME is now licensed under the MIT license!

Please note that the following licenses are applicable to the NME
code only.  Any code related to the SDL group of libraries
are subject to their own licence terms and must be obeyed accordingly.
These are generally LGPL, which means static linking against these could
cause problems.  However, iPhone is the only target that uses static linking,
and that target does not use SDL.

Simply put - please use it!  (but don't blame us if it goes wrong).

To make myself clear, I waive any requirement to distribute the
copyright notice with anything except substantial portions of the SOURCE CODE.
