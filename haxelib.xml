    <description>NME stands for Neko Media Engine and provides graphics and sound for several haXe output format.  It was originally an SDL wrapper, but this has changed a bit, and now it does not always use SDL.  The graphics and sound API is highly compatible with the flash9 drawing (vector and bitmaps) and sound APIs.  Hardware acceleration (via OpenGL/OpenGLES) is used where possible.</description>
    <version name="2.0.0">Major overhaul, moving much of the implementation into the C++ code, removing the need for SDL and adding initial Android support.</version>
