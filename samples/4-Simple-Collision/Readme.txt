This collision example shows several factors of the NME wrapper:

1. Creating and animating sprites.

2. Moving a sprite with a mouse or keyboard.

3. Detecting collisions between sprites using both bounding box and pixel perfect collisions.


Note: there is some know bug in this - will try to fix it soon
